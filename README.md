# Image-recognition-mini-project
Convolutional neural network is a feedforward neural network whose artificial neurons can respond to peripheral units within a partial coverage perform well for large image processing. In this mini
project, you can build a convolutional neural network that will be trained on few thousand images of
cats and dogs, and later be able to predict if the given image is of a cat or a dog.
